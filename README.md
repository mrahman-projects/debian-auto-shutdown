### Step 1: Create the Script

1. **Open a Text Editor:**
   Use your preferred text editor to create the script. You can do this with a command like `nano` or `vim`. For example:
   ```bash
   sudo nano /usr/local/bin/auto_shut.sh
   ```

2. **Enter the Script Content:**
   Copy and paste the revised script content into the editor.

3. **Save and Exit:**
   Save the file and exit the editor. In `nano`, this is done by pressing `Ctrl + X`, then `Y` to confirm, and `Enter` to save.

### Step 2: Set Script Permissions

1. **Make the Script Executable:**
   Change the script's permissions to make it executable:
   ```bash
   sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/auto_shut.sh
   ```

### Step 3: Create the Check File Directory

1. **Create Directory for Check File:**
   If the directory for the check file doesn't exist, create it. Ensure the directory is secure and not easily accessible by non-privileged users.
   ```bash
   sudo mkdir -p /path/to/checkfile_directory
   ```

### Step 4: Update the Crontab

1. **Edit the Root's Crontab:**
   Open the root user's crontab for editing:
   ```bash
   sudo crontab -e
   ```

2. **Add the Script to Crontab:**
   Add a line to execute the script at reboot:
   ```
   @reboot /usr/local/bin/auto_shut.sh
   ```

3. **Save and Exit:**
   Save the changes to the crontab and exit the editor.

### Step 5: Test the Script

1. **Run the Script Manually:**
   Test the script by running it manually:
   ```bash
   sudo /usr/local/bin/auto_shut.sh
   ```

2. **Check Scheduled Shutdown:**
   Check if the shutdown is scheduled (only do this if you expect the script to schedule a shutdown):
   ```bash
   sudo shutdown -c
   ```

3. **Observe Behavior:**
   Observe the server's behavior. Ensure it follows the expected logic based on the current time and the `SHUTDOWN_DATETIME` set in the script.

### Step 6: Modify and Reload as Needed

1. **Edit the Script for Date Changes:**
   If you need to change the shutdown date/time:
   ```bash
   sudo nano /usr/local/bin/auto_shut.sh
   ```
   Make your changes, save, and exit.

2. **Re-Run the Script:**
   Run the script again to apply the changes:
   ```bash
   sudo /usr/local/bin/auto_shut.sh
   ```

### Additional Tips

- **Backup Your Script:** Regularly back up your script and any other critical configuration files.
- **Documentation:** Keep documentation of the script's purpose and functionality, especially if other administrators will be managing the server.
- **Security Practices:** As this script has significant power over the system's operation, ensure it's secured against unauthorized access or modification. 

This guide provides a comprehensive approach to deploying and managing the auto-shutdown script on your server. Always remember to adapt steps as necessary to fit your specific server environment and administrative practices.
